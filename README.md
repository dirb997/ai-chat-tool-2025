## ChatBot with GUI created to be used with DeepSeek AI API

* As of February 2, 2025, we have not been able to obtain an API key from DeepSeek. While the logic and functionality of the chatbot are in place, its main purpose—chatting—cannot be tested at this time.

* Update (February 6, 2025): Due to certain constraints, the API services are currently interrupted. We will provide an update as soon as the service is restored. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
